\title{
  The constructor to create the stepp window object
}

\description{
  This is the constructor function to create a stepp window object.
}

\usage{
  stepp.win(type, r1, r2, basedon="all")
}

\arguments{
  \item{type}{type of stepp window; "sliding" or "tail-oriented"}
  \item{r1}{sliding window: minimum number of patients allowed in overlapping windows;\cr
	    tail-oriented window: a vector of maximum covariate values for each subpopulation}
  \item{r2}{sliding window: size of subpopulation in each window;\cr
	    tail-oriented window: a vector of minimum covariate values for each subpopulation}
  \item{basedon}{what the window is based on - "all" (default)"}
}

\details{
  This is the functional interface to construct a stepp window object besides
  using new("stwin", ...). A STEPP window specifies a pattern of subpopulation you would like
  to explore. There are two kinds of patterns: "sliding window" and "tail-oriented window". 
  Both patterns are specified through a set of (r1, r2) values:
  1. for sliding windows, r1 is the minimum number of patients allowed in overlapping windows
     and r2 is the approximate size of subpopulation in each window; 
  2. for tail-oriented window, r1 is a vector of maximum covariate value for each subpopulation
     from the minimum value of the entire subpopulation, and r2 is a vector of minimum covariate
     values for each subpopulation from the maximum value of the window. The utility function, 
     gen.tailwin, can be used to generate these two vectors based on the number of desired 
     subpopulations. 

  Both pattern are based on all patients.
